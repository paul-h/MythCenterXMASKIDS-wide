===============================================
 The 'MythCenterXMASKIDS-wide' theme for MythTV
===============================================

This is a kids Christmas version of the popular MythCenterXMAS-wide theme.
It has random Christmas themed background images and a few animated gifs
hidden on a few screens. There is also a festive colour scheme.

Background Images
-----------------
The backgrounds where found over a long period of time so have forgot where
most of them came from but I believe all are free to use for non commercial use.

If you recognise an image and want attribution let me know and I will add it here.
